Steganography is the technique of hiding information within digital media, such as images, audio, video, or text, in a way that makes the presence of the hidden data undetectable. Unlike cryptography, which encrypts data into an unreadable format, steganography ensures secrecy by embedding messages in a way that appears natural. One of the most common methods is image steganography, where data is concealed within an image by modifying the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of pixel values. Since these changes are visually imperceptible, the hidden message remains unnoticed.

Steganography plays a crucial role in secure communication, digital watermarking, and cybersecurity. It is widely used for protecting sensitive information, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring copyright protection in media files. Additionally, intelligence agencies and military operations use steganography for covert messaging. Compared to cryptography, which transforms data into an encrypted format that is obvious to attackers, steganography keeps the existence of the message secret, making it harder to detect. However, combining both techniques enhances security by ensuring both confidentiality and secrecy.

With advancements in digital forensics, steganography has also evolved, and various sophisticated detection methods are now used to identify hidden data. Despite this, it remains an effective tool for digital security, data protection, and privacy enhancement. By integrating steganography into cybersecurity frameworks, individuals and organizations can safeguard confidential information and maintain secure communication channels without raising suspicion.
